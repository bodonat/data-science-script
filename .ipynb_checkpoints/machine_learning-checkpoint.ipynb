Classifiers that give curves closer to the top-left corner indicate a better performance. Note that the ROC does not depend on the class distribution and this makes it useful for evaluating classifiers predicting rare events such as diseases or disasters. In contrast, evaluating performance using accuracy would favor classifiers that always predict a negative outcome for rare events. To compare different classifiers, it is useful to summarize the performance of each classifier into a single measure- **AUC** (area under the ROC curve).

Repeat this until each of k-subsets has served as the test set. The average of your *k* recorded accuracy is called the cross-validation accuracy and will serve you as your performance metric for the model.

    "* **Regularization** is a form of regression which discourages learning a more complex or flexible model, so as to avoid the risk of overfitting. The general idea is to penalize complicated models by adding an additional penalty to the loss function in order to generate a larger loss. In this way, we can discourage the model from learning too many details and the model is much more general. Three popular methods are Ridge regression (L2 norm, most used), Lasso (L1 norm) and Dropout (used in neural networks). If there is noise in the training data, then estimated coefficients won't generalize well to the future data and this is where regularization comes in. It happens by adding a tuning parameter  λ that decides how much we want to penalize the flexibility of our model. As the value of λ rises, it reduces the value of coefficients and thus reducing the variance. Till a point, this increase in  λ is beneficial as it is only reducing the variance (hence avoiding overfitting), without loosing any important properties in the data. But after certain value, the model starts lossing important properties, giving rise to bias in the model and thus underfitting.\n",

We take the patterns learned by a previous model and test them on a dataset when training the new model. In each iteration, we give more importance to observations in the dataset that are incorrectly handled or predicted by previous models. It is useful in reducing bias also.\n",
    "    2. **Bagging** is an ensemble learning method where we generate some data using the bootstrap method, in which we use an already existing dataset and generate multiple samples of the „N“ size. This bootstrapped data is then used to train multiple models in parallel, which makes it more robust than a simple model. Once all the models are trained and it is time to make a prediction, we make predictions using all the trained models and then average the result in the case of regression, and for classification, we choose the result that has the highest frequency.\n",
    "    3. **Stacking** is an ensemble learning method where we can combine weak models that can additionaly use different learning algorithms as well. These learners are called heterogeneous learners (boosting and bagging are homogeneous learners). Stacking works by training multiple and different weak models or learners and then using them together by training another model, called a meta-model, to make predictions."

Gradient measures the change in parameter with respect to the change in error. **Learning rate** or step size is the size of the steps that are taken to reach the minimum.
