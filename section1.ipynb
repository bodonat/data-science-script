    "Python is an interpreted language. Developer does not assign data types to variables at the time of coding, i.e. it automatically gets assigned during execution. Everything in Python is considered as an object (it has an ID, a type, and a value), even functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap and the programmer does not have access to it. The Python interpreter takes care of this instead. The allocation of heap space for objects is done by Python's memory manager. Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so it can be made available to the heap space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules vs packages vs libraries. A Python module can be simple Python file, i.e. a combination of numerous functions and global variables. A Python package is a collection of different Python modules (like a directory of modules). Python libraries are a collection of Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python are „first class citizens“. This means that they support operations such as being passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified and assigned to a variable. For arguments, we use * args when we aren't sure how many arguments are going to be passed, or if we want to pass a stored list or tuple of arguments to a function. Also, ** kwargs is used when we don't know how many keyword arguments will be passed to a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments. The identifiers are conventional, you could also use * bob and ** billy. A function produces a „side effect“ if it does anything other than take a value in and return another value/s. For egz., it could be writing to a file, modifying some global variable.. Sometimes you need to have side effects in a program and in these cases you should centralize and indicate where you are incorporating side effect with *global* keyword near the targeted variable. \n",

    "*   **Namespace** is a collection of currently defined symbolic names along with information about the object that each name references. An assignment statement creates a symbolic name that you can use to reference an object. The statement x='foo', creates a symbolic name x that refers to the string object 'foo'. It is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts. There are four types of namespaces with differing lifetimes: built-in, global, enclosing, local.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Little more on the local and enclosing namespaces. The interpreter creates a new namespace whenever a function executes. That namespace is local to the function and remains in existence until the function terminates. When there is function defined inside other function, outer function is called enclosing function, and inner is called enclosed function. So, the namespace created for enclosing function is called enclosing namespace.\n",

Immutables are: numeric data types (integers, and other built-in numeric data such as booleans, floats, complex numbers, fractions and decimals), strings, bytes, frozen sets and tuples.\n",
    "* **Hashable** is a feature of Python objects that tells if the object has a hash value or not. Hash value is a numeric value of fixed length that uniquely identifies data. If the object has a hash value then it can be used as a key for dictionary or as an element in a set. An object is hashable if it has a hash value that does not change during its entire lifetime. Almost all immutable objects are hashable, i.e. all built-in types has a hash method. Unhashable are: dict, list and set."

Changes made in any member of the class will also affect the original copy of it. But, since it creates a new object, changes like adding or removing items won't affect the original list, i.e. new list has its own pointer, but its elements don't. In the case of deep copy, a copy of the object is copied into another object. It means that any changes made to a copy of the object do not reflect in the original object.

This functions are handy in cases where callables must be stored, passed as arguments (egz. For map(), sorted(), itertools, groupby()), or returned as function results. Probably the most used function is .itemgetter() with which you can sort some list of tuples, or dict,.. with specified key, and is also faster than sort function. It is also more clearable than lambda function when sending as an argument\n",
    "\n",
    "    egz. If you want to sort some lists/dict first by 2nd element and then by 1st element, you can use key=itemgetter(1,0).\n",
