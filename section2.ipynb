    "* **Handling outliers:** if the data has garbage value or has extreme values you can drop it. Otherwise, you can maybe try different models, normalize data or use algorithms that are less affected by it\n",
    "* Difference between **error terms and residuals:** an error term is generally unobservable and a residual is observable and calculable, making it much easier to quantify and visualize. In effect, while an error term represents the way observed data differs from the actual population, a residual represents the way it differs from sample population data. Residuals actually helps us get an accurate estimate of the error.\n",

    "* **Deterministic vs stochastic process:** a deterministic process is a mathematical model where the output depends solely on the input, and there is no randomness involved. In contrast, a stochastic process is a mathematical model that involves randomness and is used to model situations that may not have inherent randomness. A deterministic model is completely predictable also.\n",
    "* **Unit root** is a feature of some stochastic processes. A linear stochastic process has a unit root if 1 is a root of the process's characteristic equation. Such a process is non-stationary. If the other roots of the characteristic equation lie inside the unit circle, then the first difference of the process will be stationary; otherwise, the process will need to be differenced multiple times to become stationary.\n",
    "* **Bias** is a systematic tendency to underestimate or overestimate the value of a parameter (you were not random!). It implies that the data selection may have been skewed by the collection criteria (in favor or against an idea). It can also be defined as a systematic (built-in) error which makes all values wrong by a certain amount. In ML, the inability for a ML method to capture the true relationship is called bias, that happens because algorithm makes simplified assumptions so that it can easily understand the target function."
